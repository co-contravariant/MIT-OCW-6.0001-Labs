# MIT-OCW-6.0001-Labs
My solutions to several labs in MIT's online introduction to python course.

In Problem Set 3, I simulate dealing and scoring a hand in scrabble.

The next 2 problem sets are essentially exercises in the basics of object oriented programming and inheritance.

In Problem Set 4, I construct several (simple) ciphers for encrypting text. 

In Problem Set 5, I create a program which monitors news feeds on the internet.
